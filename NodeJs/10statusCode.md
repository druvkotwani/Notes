HTTP status codes are three-digit numbers returned by servers in response to HTTP requests made by browsers. They are categorized into five main classes, each indicating a different outcome of the request:

1. **1XX Informational**: These codes indicate that the request was received and is being processed. They are temporary and do not indicate the final outcome of the request. Examples include:

   - 100 Continue
   - 101 Switching Protocols
   - 102 Processing
   - 103 Early Hints

2. **2XX Success**: These codes indicate that the request was successfully received, understood, and accepted. The most common of these is:

   - 200 OK: The request was successful, and the server has sent the requested data.

3. **3XX Redirection**: These codes indicate that the client must take additional action to complete the request. They are used when resources have been moved or are temporarily unavailable. Examples include:

   - 301 Moved Permanently
   - 302 Found
   - 303 See Other

4. **4XX Client Errors**: These codes indicate that the request contains bad syntax or cannot be fulfilled by the server. They are caused by issues on the client side. Examples include:

   - 400 Bad Request
   - 401 Unauthorized
   - 404 Not Found

5. **5XX Server Errors**: These codes indicate that the server failed to fulfill a valid request. They are caused by issues on the server side. Examples include:
   - 500 Internal Server Error
   - 502 Bad Gateway
   - 503 Service Unavailable

Understanding these status codes is crucial for debugging web applications, as they provide insight into what went wrong with a request. For instance, a 404 error indicates that the requested resource was not found on the server, while a 500 error suggests a server-side issue that needs to be addressed by the server administrator or developer.

To check the HTTP status codes on a website, you can use developer tools in browsers like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, or monitor them using tools like Google Search Console [1][2][3][4].
