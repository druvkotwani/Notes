Middleware in Express and Node.js is a powerful feature that allows you to execute code, modify request and response objects, end the request-response cycle, or call the next middleware function in the stack. Middleware functions have access to the HTTP request (`req`), response (`res`), and the `next` function in the applicationâ€™s request-response cycle. The `next` function is crucial for passing control to the next middleware function in the stack. If a middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, it must call `next()` to avoid leaving the request hanging [0][1][2].

There are two main types of middleware in Express:

1. **Application-level middleware**: These are functions that are bound to an instance of the app object using `app.use()` and `app.METHOD()`, where `METHOD` is the HTTP method (e.g., GET, PUT, POST) in lowercase. Application-level middleware can be mounted at the root of the app (to run for every request) or at specific paths. For example, to log the current time for every request, you would use `app.use()` without specifying a path. To log the request type for requests to a specific path, you would use `app.use('/user/:id', middlewareFunction)` [0].

2. **Router-level middleware**: These are functions that are bound to an instance of `express.Router()`. Router-level middleware works similarly to application-level middleware but is scoped to a particular router instance. This allows for more modular and reusable middleware configurations. For example, you can create a router for user-related routes and apply middleware to authenticate users before they access certain routes [0].

Middleware functions can be declared in an array for reusability. This is useful for grouping related middleware functions together and applying them to multiple routes. For example, you might have middleware functions for logging the original URL and request method, which you can then apply to multiple routes using an array [0].

Creating custom middleware involves defining a function with the signature `(req, res, next) => { /* middleware code */ }`. This function can modify the request and response objects, execute any code, end the request-response cycle, or call the next middleware function in the stack. Middleware functions are essential for tasks such as logging, request parsing, authentication, and more [2].

In summary, middleware in Express and Node.js is a flexible and powerful feature that allows developers to build modular and reusable code to handle HTTP requests and responses. Middleware functions can be used at both the application and router levels, providing a wide range of possibilities for customizing the behavior of your Express applications.
