Here are 20 interview questions on Next.js along with their answers:

1. **What is Next.js?**

   - Next.js is an open-source React-based framework created by Vercel, designed for building server-side rendered and static web applications. It enhances React with features like server-side rendering, static site generation, and more, making it a powerful tool for web development [2].

2. **How is Next.js different from other JavaScript frameworks?**

   - Next.js stands out for its built-in support for server-side rendering (SSR), automatic code splitting, API routes, built-in image optimization, and easy deployment. These features make it particularly suitable for building high-performance web applications [2].

3. **What are the key features of Next.js?**

   - Key features include server-side rendering (SSR), static site generation (SSG), file system-based routing, automatic code splitting, and API routes. These features simplify and enhance the development of web applications [2].

4. **How does Next.js handle client-side navigation?**

   - Next.js uses the HTML5 History API for client-side navigation, providing a smooth transition between pages without a full page reload. It uses the `Link` component for this purpose [2].

5. **What are the benefits of using Next.js?**

   - Benefits include server-side rendering for better SEO and performance, static site generation for faster loading times, automatic code splitting for improved performance, built-in CSS support for styling, and API routes for serverless functions [2].

6. **Is Next.js a backend, frontend, or full-stack framework?**

   - Next.js is considered a full-stack framework as it allows rendering content on both the client-side and server-side [2].

7. **How can data be fetched in Next.js?**

   - Data can be fetched in Next.js using `getServerSideProps` for server-side rendering, `getStaticProps` for static-site rendering, and SWR or `useEffect` for client-side rendering. Incremental Static Regeneration can be enabled with the `revalidate` prop within `getStaticProps` [2].

8. **What is the difference between Next.js and React.js?**

   - Next.js is a framework built on top of React, providing additional features like SSR, static site generation, and API routes. React.js is a library for building user interfaces, focusing on the UI components [2].

9. **Explain the purpose of the `_app.js` file in Next.js.**

   - The `_app.js` file is used to override the default App component in Next.js, allowing for global styles, layout components, and third-party library initialization across all pages [2].

10. **What are some of the major companies that use Next.js?**

    - Major companies using Next.js include Netflix, GitHub, and Vercel itself. These companies benefit from Next.js's performance and scalability [1].

11. **Which key features are provided by Next.js in terms of SEO?**

    - Next.js enhances SEO through server-side rendering, static site generation, and the ability to pre-render pages at build time, making content easily accessible to search engine bots [1].

12. **How does Next.js support server-side rendering (SSR)?**

    - Next.js supports SSR by rendering pages on the server and sending the fully rendered page to the client. This improves SEO and initial page load performance [2].

13. **What is the role of the `Link` component in Next.js?**

    - The `Link` component in Next.js is used for client-side navigation, enabling smooth transitions between pages without a full page reload [2].

14. **How does Next.js handle static site generation (SSG)?**

    - Next.js supports SSG by pre-rendering pages at build time, resulting in faster loading times and better SEO [2].

15. **What is automatic code splitting in Next.js?**

    - Automatic code splitting in Next.js involves splitting the JavaScript code into smaller chunks, loading only whatâ€™s necessary for each page. This enhances performance by reducing initial bundle sizes [2].

16. **How does Next.js simplify API route creation?**

    - Next.js simplifies the creation of API routes by allowing developers to define serverless functions alongside their pages, making it easy to handle backend logic without a separate server [2].

17. **What is built-in CSS support in Next.js?**

    - Next.js provides built-in support for styling solutions, including CSS modules, styled-jsx, and support for CSS-in-JS libraries, allowing developers to choose their preferred styling approach [2].

18. **How does Next.js improve performance?**

    - Next.js improves performance through features like server-side rendering, static site generation, automatic code splitting, and optimized builds. These features reduce the load on servers and improve the user experience [2].

19. **What is the difference between `getServerSideProps` and `getStaticProps` in Next.js?**

    - `getServerSideProps` is used for server-side rendering, where pages are rendered on each request. `getStaticProps` is used for static site generation, where pages are pre-rendered at build time [2].

20. **How does Next.js support incremental static regeneration (ISR)?**
    - Next.js supports ISR by allowing pages to be rebuilt at specified time intervals, ensuring that the content remains fresh and updated without needing to rebuild the entire site [2].

These questions and answers cover a wide range of topics related to Next.js, from its basic features and benefits to more advanced concepts like server-side rendering, static site generation, and incremental static regeneration.
