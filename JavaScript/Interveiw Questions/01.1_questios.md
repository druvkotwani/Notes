## Answers

Given the focus on JavaScript concepts such as variables (`var`, `let`, and `const`), their scope, hoisting, function expressions, and the temporal dead zone, here are the answers to the theory questions based on the understanding of JavaScript:

### Variables: `var`, `let`, and `const`

1. **Output**: `undefined`
2. **Output**: `ReferenceError: x is not defined`
3. **Output**: `ReferenceError: x is not defined`
4. **Answer**: `var` is function-scoped, `let` and `const` are block-scoped.
5. **Output**:
   ```
   2
   2
   ```
6. **Output**:
   ```
   2
   1
   ```
7. **Output**: `TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.`
8. **Output**: `{ a: 2 }`
9. **Output**: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
10. **Output**: `TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.`

### Hoisting

11. **Output**: `undefined`
12. **Output**: `ReferenceError: x is not defined`
13. **Output**: `ReferenceError: x is not defined`
14. **Answer**: Function declarations are hoisted, function expressions are not.
15. **Output**: `Hello, World!`
16. **Output**: `TypeError: myFunction is not a function`
17. **Output**: `undefined`
18. **Output**: `undefined`
19. **Answer**: Variables declared with `var` are hoisted to the top of their scope and initialized with `undefined`. `let` and `const` are hoisted to the top of their block but remain uninitialized until their definition is evaluated, which is why accessing them before declaration results in a `ReferenceError`.
20. **Output**: `TypeError: myFunction is not a function`

### Temporal Dead Zone

21. **Output**: `undefined`
22. **Output**: `ReferenceError: x is not defined`
23. **Output**: `ReferenceError: x is not defined`
24. **Answer**: The temporal dead zone refers to the period from the start of the block until the declaration where `let` and `const` variables cannot be accessed.
25. **Output**: `ReferenceError: x is not defined`
26. **Output**: `ReferenceError: x is not defined`
27. **Output**: `10`
28. **Output**: `ReferenceError: x is not defined`
29. **Output**: `ReferenceError: x is not defined`
30. **Output**: `10`

### Function Expressions

31. **Output**: `Hello, World!`
32. **Output**: `Hello, World!`
33. **Output**: `myFunction`
34. **Output**: `myFunction`
35. **Answer**: Function declarations are hoisted and initialized with the function, whereas function expressions are hoisted but not initialized until their definition is evaluated.
36. **Output**: `TypeError: myFunction is not a function`
37. **Output**: `TypeError: myFunction is not a function`
38. **Output**: `undefined`
39. **Answer**: Function expressions do not have their own name property, whereas function declarations do.
40. **Output**: `10`

These answers are based on the understanding of JavaScript's behavior regarding variable declarations, scope, hoisting, and function expressions. They reflect the nuanced differences between `var`, `let`, and `const`, the impact of hoisting and the temporal dead zone, and the characteristics of function expressions.
