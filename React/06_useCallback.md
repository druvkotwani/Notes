The `useCallback` hook in React is used to return a memoized version of a callback function that only changes if one of the dependencies has changed. This can enhance performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders and computations

Here's a simple example:

```jsx
import React, { useState, useCallback } from "react";

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  const increment = useCallback(() => {
    setCount(count + 1);
  }, [count]);

  return (
    <div>
      Count: {count}
      <button onClick={increment}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

In this example, `useCallback` is used to memoize the `increment` function. This means that the `increment` function will not be recreated every time the `Example` component re-renders, but only when the `count` state changes. This can be beneficial in scenarios where passing the `increment` function as a prop to a child component that is optimized with `React.memo`. Without `useCallback`, the child component would re-render every time the parent component re-renders, even if the props haven't changed .

However, it's important to note that using `useCallback` is not always necessary and can sometimes lead to unnecessary complexity. You should consider using it when the performance gain outweighs the added complexity in your specific use case .
